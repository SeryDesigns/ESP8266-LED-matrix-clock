# ESP8266-LED-matrix-clock

This project is a simple LED matrix clock using ESP8266, LED matrix ([like this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001296969309.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.17.69da2e5cNWhaAU&algo_pvid=78440454-faa3-407d-a382-5c1200a41a29&algo_exp_id=78440454-faa3-407d-a382-5c1200a41a29-8&pdp_npi=3%40dis%21USD%216.71%214.56%21%21%21%21%21%40214527c616826306162721042d0723%2110000015656587031%21sea%21IL%210&curPageLogUid=bV9F1Q0t7t52)), DHT11, and a button.  
The whole project started after my wife asked for a clock, of course I could simply buy a clock, but why bother if I can spend tons of hours building one myself?
And of course if I'm building a clock myself, why not add it some more features? Such as showing the current local weather and room temperature and humidity.
I've also designed and 3D printed the enclosure and some light diffuser since I didn't like to look of the LEDs without a cover.
I wanted to create a simple project that will not require a PCB and so all the electronics can be soldered togheter pretty easily.
At the end I've sepnd most of my time on coding (which as you can see from my code, I'm not good at) and editing the videos.
The entire design is open source hardware, I'll upload here the code, connection diagram and 3D design and STL.
I've also uploaded the 3D design files I've done in FreeCAD so if you want to modify them you can.  
I'm thinking of designing a PCB with added features like a buzzer for alarms and more buttons, and maybe some LEDs, let me know if this is something you'll be intreseted in.
